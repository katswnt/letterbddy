2025-01-14,Babygirl,2024,https://boxd.it/8t3uO7,3.5,,"I did not expect to experience a tenderness for Romy (Nicole Kidman). I’ve only seen this and <i>Bodies Bodies Bodies</i>, but the way Halina Reijn encourages her audience to suspend disbelief and allow her world—which is so close to our own—to exist without explanation is so beautiful and feels somewhat rare. We do not need to worry why a powerful ceo would risk it all for an intern, Romy wonders that herself. Each moment where we’re frustrated that Samuel (Harris Dickinson) isn’t actually who Romy thinks him to be is softened by Romy’s perspective. Each time she gains a little clarity it is about herself, not her relationship with Samuel. Her perspective is singular and full of guilt and so subtly untrustworthy that it feels like we’ve gone crazy alongside her.

The club/rave scene was so visceral and so good that it gets half a star on its own.

Kidman is phenomenal. Dickinson, Antonio Banderas, Sophie Wilde, and Esther McGregor were marvelous. Reijn and co made a beautiful movie about an oft-wrought subject through a surprising lens.

I didn’t give a shit about Epifania and Emilia bc all we ever saw was Emilia thriving. Why tf did Rita do any of this? Just money??

2025-01-23,The Stepford Wives,2004,https://boxd.it/8zXVpJ,3.5,,"<i>“Does any fraction of these women still exist?” “Of course! Almost <b>everything</b>.”</i>

The key to this movie comes from Bobbie at the 4th of July picnic when she questions why there are no Black people around. I was surprised to read that others thought that Joanna acquiesced because she trusted Walter. Joanna did not become a robot to please Walter, Joanna became a robot because she realized that Stepford was a very literal microcosm of the real world and how nice would it be to just give the fuck up and not have to figure out who you are. Misogyny is so well embedded in our culture that Joanna could never be confident that the Wives weren’t happy; they had achieved peak, perfect femininity, doesn’t that count for <i>something</i>? Walter’s hesitation to fembot Joanna endorses this reading: he knows that he will never be happy without Joanna as Joanna, but heteronormativity and gender conformation calls to him like the Green Goblin mask. Even love isn’t enough to overcome patriarchy and white supremacy. Joanna and Walter’s gleeful conformity to the robotic Stepford life shows us that they understand that their genders, marriage, and parenthood must be performed. Claire’s final reveal and the knocking-off of Mike’s head shows us that those core beliefs behind Stepford do not come from individuals but from societal stories.

Unfortunately, the metaphor gets muddied by the ending scene of the Wives waking up and the overtly campy tone. We also didn’t see Joanna suffering as the head of the company, so Claire’s ending speech comes across as insanity instead of frustration that the world is so nebulous that being brainless seems easier.

Beautiful performances from Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, and Glenn Close. Feels unnervingly contemporary. I totally understand Olivia Wilde’s excitement to make a version for the 2020s.

2025-01-24,Challengers,2024,https://boxd.it/8Azaeb,4.5,Yes,"<i>“It’s nice to see you lit up about something, even if it’s my girlfriend.”</i>

Luca Guadagnino uses <i>Challengers </i>to ask us if we’ve ever matched someone’s freak in the kind of way that Art, Patrick, and Tashi do. Luca knows his characters perfectly and shows us that it is thrilling to set our judgement aside and watch some good fucking tennis.

I understand why people might think “Patrick loved Art, Art loved Tashi, and Tashi loved tennis,” but I disagree. Patrick and Tashi had an unflappable confidence in themselves that Art knew he could never had. Patrick and Art were vulnerable with themselves and Tashi even though she never showed any interest in reciprocating that vulnerability. Art and Tashi had self awareness that Patrick knew would be too much. I was so amazed by their ability to love and fear each other’s strengths and weaknesses without having to understand them.

There are many moments in which we wonder how Art/Patrick/Tashi could possibly have misunderstood one of the others so profoundly only to be shown in the next moment that we were the ones out of the loop the whole time. Patrick asking Tashi to be his coach seemed like a misread to me until I realized that Patrick knew that Tashi would never consider it and yet asked anyway. Art knew Tashi was not in love with him the way he was in love with her, but he offered that love with no conditions and held that relationship together. Tashi knew Art and Patrick’s relationship was one she could never have with either of them, on or off the court, and stayed near that relationship regardless. In the end, they worked it out on the tennis court.

You’ll hate this movie if you need a coherent, linear narrative and like knowing what to think of characters.

I’m so scared of people who don’t think Zendaya is a good actress. Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor are fabulous, of course. Luca Guadagnino directed tf out of this and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom‘s cinematography is so life changing that you would be forgiven for ignoring how good of a screenplay this is.

It loses a star because I had some trouble staying focused since the narrative was 0, but since the whole movie is about defying convention I think that’s actually one of its strengths. So I’ll be honest and say it loses a star because I’m lame and can’t focus.

It’s so nice to see two women violently play within and throughout societal norms and very little harm to real people in such a literal way.

2025-01-25,Hot Fuzz,2007,https://boxd.it/8BCfYD,5,Yes,"Got to show my pal this movie for the first time tonight, which rocks. 

This was the first time I understood the structure of the film. When watching the scene just after the carnival where Danny pulls the stuffed monkey up into the shot only a scene after he was pictured carrying it was when it clicked: if you forgot about the monkey just because you couldn’t see it, you weren’t going to figure the movie out. The cool thing is that I’m sure this happened multiple times before the monkey scene, and it took me that long to catch on to those instructions.

Edgar Wright knows you can’t catch everything in the movie, but you don’t have to. It’s like that scene in <i>The Good Place</i> where the gang is trying to escape the Bad Place and met Michael at the train station and bragged that they found all 3 of his clues, only to be told he actually left them over a thousand clues. Every rewatch reveals more obvious answers to who was committing the murders, and those little moments serve to enrich the world instead of just merely advance the story. I love living in the weird, idiosyncratic worlds Wright dreams up, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deserve Nobel prizes or whatever.

Much scarier and creepier than the 2004 remake. The tension they build between Walter and Joanna had my blood boiling by the time they had their big argument was really fun and frustrating. Bobbie and the psychoanalyst understanding and believing Joanna was relieving; I’m so happy this didn’t turn into <i>Gaslight</i>. Joanna stabbing Bobbie was beautiful.

I like that the 1975 version didn’t have to be campy and saccharine like the remake did; I liked that all seemed normal and none of the men or Wives could understand what was so wrong about keeping a tidy home. The lack of technological advancement (and explanation in the movie) meant that we weren’t bogged down by details that distracted from the story.

A very feminist movie. Kat was a great and needed character; she was the only person on screen who understood how depraved the men around her are. Her treatment of Sergei was less taxing on her than Josh’s treatment of Sophie was to him, but that’s because Kat was the one of the two who understood that they were bad people. It was fabulous that Sergei didn’t have a companion; the men of this universe are abusers and the only thing that differentiates those who abuse companions w those that abuse humans is how much power they have to get away with it.

Eli very clearly thought he was innocent of the cruelty, selfishness, shallowness, and insecurity that Josh (and maybe all straight men in this universe) had, and I was happy to see how Eli and Patrick were unwittingly used to uphold patriarchy and heteronormativity. I noticed Patrick was always treated with far more respect than Iris, and I doubt it’s because Iris killed Eli. 

Excited for a rewatch to get more of these, but some moments that I really loved:
- the first time Iris smiles and we see her gorgeous but “imperfect” teeth. I love real teeth!!!!
- the foreshadowing around Iris being a robot
   - “beep boop” nickname
   - thanking the car
   - her first shower; her face gets wet but her makeup is perfect, her hair gets somewhat wet but she doesn’t wash it and then isn’t seen styling it. Chalked the hair up to movie bullshit at the time, but no!
     - Kat telling Iris she makes her feel “replaceable”
     - Josh and her having sex
- Josh tying his girlfriend up and the first thing he says when she wakes being “you’re okay”
- Kat calling Iris a “sock” and Josh disagreeing
- Iris using an over-engineered electric corkscrew to kill Josh

One question: why does everyone in this universe have folding phones?

Mikey Madison acted the hell out of what was written for her, but what was written for her was so empty. The entire movie I kept wondering how we were supposed to believe Ani could be so stupid.

But it seems that Sean Baker thought Ani was a very #feminist #woke character and I think he just really missed the mark. If he hadn’t failed so profoundly here, I could see why this movie would be considered one of the best of 2024. But… ugh

The bread (or lack thereof) showing that critics can ignore what is there (the sauces) in favor of what is not, the broken emulsion as an example of how a tiny flaw can negate the rest of the work in the critics’ minds, the tacos showing that consumers go into an experience with art with expectations and the art is filtered through those expectations, the printed images on the tortillas as a literal reflection of the consumer and a statement that your reflection might not be flattering from the artist’s POV, the s’mores/payment as the lengths that the desperation to understand an artists vision will take you.

👍:
- They’re so lucky they got Jennifer Lawrence for this. She CARRIED. She is one of the best actresses of her generation and lent so much complexity to Katniss that the movie otherwise struggled to portray.
- The cast was excellent and I also loved Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Willow Shields, and Amandla Stenberg.
- For a YA dystopian movie, they really swung for the fences. They used a shaky, handheld camera when the characters were more frantic. Casting young children for roles emphasized the insanity of the games. The ugliness of the deaths were shown more often than I expected. A lot of themes were heavy handed, but it’s for kids. Whatever.
- Makeup did a greaaat job. I loved that we <i>saw</i> all the makeup on the people: foundation sitting on skin, the strips of false eyelashes, lipstick smearing slightly. It did a great job of showing that the residents of the Capitol were the same type of people as everyone else, and that their lives were so easy and their looks so important that they’d dress up like that every morning.

👎:
- The story sucks if you haven’t read the book. It assumes you have. All it does is remind you of things that happen in the book, and it really doesn’t even try to stand on its own.
- The editing was so frustrating for me. So many “camera on the person talking” scenes. I counted 7 cuts in 2 seconds while Effie was speaking on stages
- The point is that this is a reality tv show… take advantage. Film it like reality tv sometimes.

Last time I watched it <a href=""https://boxd.it/8Tw2DR"" title=""I only got the point of maybe half the courses"">I only got the point of maybe half the courses</a>, and it definitely benefitted from a rewatch. I’ll add that 
- the tour of the island is prob a nice way to remind viewers that no matter the info they have into the way the art was created, they don’t have any real insight into the artist’s mind. 
- Jeremy shooting himself still confuses me, but it feels to me like watching an artist put everything they have into their art and the discomfort of seeing that sacrifice that turns into a desperation to move past it and experience that art. That idea isn’t quite there yet, tho. 
- Maybe Katherine’s course was supposed to show the disingenuous way we engage with art we feel we’re supposed to engage with? And how an artist can claim the distance between them and their consumers is however large they want it to be, but at the end of the day we all are at the same table with the art?

I gasped aloud at the shot of the statue of Cybele projected on Spartaco’s yellow dress. The sunlight filtering through the train windows in the first scene as Arthur stares down the hallway… Cybele’s head smashing into the bottom of the lake… the sun spots on Flora’s face… wow.

I’m glad I watched the Murnau and Herzog versions first, because they really emphasized where Eggers pushed past them and where he failed to meet their muster.

The role of the lighting obv changed a lot from version to version, and I think it’s because as filmmaking got more advanced it became more tempting to replace the use of light and shadows with more complicated (?) visual effects. Skarsgard is a master of his craft, but Nosferatu was scary in this version because of the nastiness they were able to cake on to Skarsgard. Nosferatu was scary in 1922 because of Murnau’s use of shadow to impose that figure over <i>everything</i>, from Wisberg to God himself. Eggers fell a little short here but it’s understandable

I loved that this <i>Nosferatu</i> is finally about Ellen!!! Ellen calls Orlok to her when she is young, Knock sent Ellen’s husband to Orlok, Orlok comes to Wisberg in pursuit of Ellen, and the lens through which the entire movie is shot is very obviously Ellen’s. Thomas (and Friedrich and Anne and Sievers and) all tell her to be quiet and stop sharing her stupid dumb nightmares and to get over herself. Ellen’s sexuality is sinful (her father told her so very literally) and disgusting, and her marriage with Thomas reorients her darkness into something she can understand because her sexuality is finally permissible. Thomas learns to believe his wife (ugh) and seems to understand her, but only when it’s just too late.

Ellen seeks understanding from a female friend who instead rebuffs her with cries of holiness and God. Her friend’s nasty nasty husband thinks restraining and drugging her makes sense, because it’s the only way he could stop her from “tearing the room into ribbons” (how inconvenient!). Anna and Friedrich’s sexuality is Puritan Perfect: look how they have gone forth and multiplied! Thomas and Ellen can only scrabble at each other’s clothes in their friends’ foyer after Anna and Friedrich left to put their perfect blonde babies to bed. 

Van Helsing, I mean Von Frantz, is the only person who gets asymptotically close to understanding Ellen, and it is because he approaches her with the kindness and grace to find her uniqueness. She is not just a Woman or Wife, but a conduit for a demon, and that makes her deserving of attention and understanding. In a moment of really beautiful connection that showcases Defoe and Depp, Von Frantz tells Ellen “In heathen times, you might have been a great priestess of Isis, yet, in this strange and modern world your purpose is of greater worth: you are our salvation.” Heathen times—for which the Romani are our stand in—are literally without God, but also show women with knowledge and agency. (1) Ellen called Orlok to her // her sexual desire is the origin of the curse. (2) Ellen tries to share her knowledge and nobody believes her, meaning that Orlok successfully arrives in Wisberg and brings the plague // society represses that desire and suffers for it (3) Ellen reasserts that she can put an end to it all // society very literally suffers and degrades because of their dismissal of a woman (4) Ellen finally, of her own free will, distracts Orlok by feeding him and laying with him until sunrise, dying at the last moment // Ellen exerts her agency for the first time and society is better for it, but she dies before she can experience the fruits of her pain. If Orlok is Ellen’s spirit or sexual desire or sin, the moment she fully accepts that rot is when the plague is lifted. Eggers was completely spot on with this shift of focus, and the story is much stronger for it. 

Some unfortunate negatives:
- So much ~atmosphere~, not much substance. I think I’m using this term wrong, but the mis en scene felt sooooo Epcot. I think an intern must have been in charge of the framing for most of the movie, and for a movie about filth and cleanliness there wasn’t quite enough of either for me. 
- ATJ and Emma Corrin, you are so sexy but this wasn’t your strongest acting performance and that really took me out of things at times
- The costuming was gorgeous but did not tell a story at all. I spent a bunch of the first act wondering why tf the Hutters were so down bad that Thomas would spend 6 weeks crossing the Carpathians 
- No bow for the Romani storyline??? You’re going to make this huge declaration about believing women and then miss the entire point of the Romani being there?????????????????

Despite the huge strides in character for Ellen, I’m not so sure that Eggers made a net improvement on either the Murnau or Herzog versions.

Need to make a list of male characters I could literally punch in the face. Francois is a motherfucker and a cute-postal-worker-fucker and Agnes Varda is a genius.

- The chemistry between Kena and Ziki is awesome
- Kena falling for Ziki while Ziki wears a tank top that says “bad news” is so cute
- Kena going from pushing Ziki’s hand away in church because tender queer love wasn’t possible to being forced to allow dozens of hands on her to pray the gay away :///////////

I cannot overstate the aesthetic beauty of this movie. As someone who can really let the vibe of a movie carry me far, this movie was made for me to like it. I am certain this will become a favorite rewatch, but I think it’s because of how weak the performances are, the bonkers ADR, and the #vibe.

- I love how stylized this movie is. Such a beautiful technicolor campy 60s interpretation of the Philosophy of Witchcraft class I took my senior year of college.

I can't decide between a 7/10 and 8/10, but going with 7. I have only seen two Eggers films, this and <a href=""https://boxd.it/97cQ6f"" rel=""nofollow"">Nosferatu</a>. I want to give him immense credit for the production of this movie; at no point does the set feel like a set, and I was wholly immersed in this Viking-era revenge fantasy. His camerawork was occasionally perplexing, but I kept writing down things to google to check how historically accurate they were because it felt like Eggers really had fun creating this world! 

At the beginning of the movie, Willem Dafoe's jester makes a joke about the queen that Fjölnir takes poorly. Ethan Hawke (the king) defends the jester, saying that it was a joke and that he loves him very much so please don't kill him. Eggers tells us here that he wants us to watch this movie from a place of moral ambiguity. If you spend the whole 132 minutes going ""aww, geez, they killed that kid!"" this is a really bad movie for you to watch. THAT BEING SAID... Eggers, you gotta take somewhat of a moral stance on the dynamics we still see in 21st century America, dude. I think Eggers is trying to say something profound about women and how often they’re overlooked, even by the men who think they see them clearly, but it falls so flat. I was disappointed to see Amleth telling Olga he found the weapon with which he’ll kill Fjölnir and her immediately asking when he’ll do it and him answering with “when I must,” because Olga’s face doesn’t move to indicate that she was almost raped the night before and was very clearly hoping Fjölnir would die before he could try again. This is about Amleth’s revenge; we know that the world is a bit of unreliable and fantastical, but it is wild to me to include so much of the violence against women without actually giving a fuck about it.

Again, I understand that this movie is presenting the violence of the era without moral judgement; the rape of women is background, injuries are gratuitous, and that insane field hockey game is both fun and real war. I don't take umbrage with that. I find issue in its gesture towards women as ""important"" and ""ignored"" that hopes the viewers are able to just say ""yeah, and that's bad!"" without spending any time with why those gender dynamics are interesting or important to portray. I see a lot of ideas about power here, but I don’t think Eggers really engaged those ideas. 

Later, Olga has sex with Amleth! I do know that Olga is a whole person and a great number of slaves had enriching personal lives (or whatever you want to call this), but it feels like we’re missing a great deal of Olga’s personhood! This has no payoff for her (later, her dipshit boyfriend will jump off a boat to avoid being a responsible father (now I’m just being really uncharitable)). Of course Olga would want to have sex with Amleth, he’s so manly and masculine and man-ish and he is so devoted to his cause and manly, ooh. Come on. I don’t care that the mother, ooooh twist, didn’t fuck with her previous captor. Oh how crazy. I think we were supposed to note how women often run the show there, but what? There is so much sloppy ""look how everyone suffers"" that it really dilutes any messaging Eggers wanted to deliver.

Overall, this movie is really gorgeous and technically impressive and a Good Film. I think it's just all surface level and boring. In high school, a bunch of dudes in the grade below me started hosting these weekend parties where they whacked each other with nerf swords and ate rotisserie chickens with their hands (I was never invited, despite my long blonde hair and giant blue eyes). They would have LOVED this film had it come out in 2016.","2020s, bechdel fail, good acting, good score, good cinematography, beautiful, malleus maleficarum, mooford loved this, watched in santa barbara, zombies, revenge",2025-03-29

- I love movies that lean heavily on symbolism and aesthetics, so this was perfect for me. The way Jane Campion had her characters interact with those symbols was really interesting; Kay, for instance, knew exactly why she had trouble with trees.
- When I saw the question mark on Louie’s forehead, I had to pause the screen and do a lap around the room. It made me tingle and scream and do a backflip. Absolute cinema ✋🏼🤩🤚🏼
- These shots are so gorgeous. I really love the color and the framing and the lens choices. I cannot figure out how to explain it, but they feel like they know they’re making a movie and know the limitations that visual media impose: if you see something, you know what it looks like and you can’t use your imagination. <i>Sweetie</i> knows this, and takes advantage.
- I think this is one of those movies where it could have only ended with the death of Sweetie. <i>Sweetie</i> takes place at any point in this family’s life, we just happened to be around to see it end. Sweetie had been that way forever and would be that way forever, as would her family. Their inability to recognize their situation meant that they would not be the ones to save themselves from it. There was no version of this movie that ended with Sweetie getting better or changing or leaving or any of the family members gaining any degree of separation from each other.

</i>
Watching this movie made me realize I <i>do</i> understand the difference between surrealism and postmodernism! It also made me understand <a href=""https://boxd.it/9fuxDd"" rel=""nofollow""><i>le charme discret de la bourgeoisie</i></a><i> </i>and now I want to rewatch it. 

Loved the constant cat comparisons, because male characters approached the comparison from a very different angle than Buñuel and the female characters did. I know that this is an adaptation of a novel, but I was so struck by how irreverently Buñuel treated everything except (1) Séverine’s sexuality and (2) the fashion. 

(1) I’m going to choose to believe that Belle de Jour lived entirely within Séverine’s mind, but had such a blast watching it all happen and trying to figure it out. The men’s emotional and intellectual impotence was skillfully juxtaposed with their confidence in their sexual desires, which made the characterization of the women all the more powerful. Buñuel stuck the landing with Marcel’s disgust with Séverine as soon as she revealed herself to be as sexually self-aware as he (do I need a Madonna-whore complex tag? Might make one). I enjoyed that the escorts were pragmatic about gendered dynamics, particularly within sex, but that Buñuel crafted their world such that they didn’t need to be pragmatic about anything else. I am grateful that this exploration of the harm that comes to women was not trauma porn. 

(2) Yves Saint Laurent has been my favorite designer of all time since I was 12 and dragged my dad to see his exhibit at the de Young three times in a row. I didn’t know why he #got me, but boy did he #get me. 7 years later I would drag my dad throughout Marrakech to see the various Saint Laurent exhibits. His work in this film is a master class. The way he plays with color alone deserves treatises and encyclopedias and songs and Nobel prizes. Séverine’s patent leather coat actually took my breath away

Every second of this movie feels so fresh and contemporary that I couldn’t believe it. Hearing Bette Davis cry out that some months ago she had turned <i>forty!</i> reminds you that the more things change the more they stay the same. This is the kind of movie that makes me feel really close to the rest of humanity. 75 years ago people spent nights partying with their friends that they get annoyed by and thinking of quippy things to say and wondering if that girl is trying to steal your boyfriend or if you’re jealous and fluffing your hair when you’re nervous. I understand why this is so well-loved, I love it too.

I leaned forward the first time Eve met Margo and didn’t disengage for the rest of the movie. I loved that Eve is a fantastic storyteller. I think it does a marvelous job at introducing doubt to the viewer without making the characters in the movie suspicious; we know Eve wins an acting award and that Margo doesn’t clap for her, so we know Eve can act and that things soured between them, so we see duplicity in Eve that no one else can. I think it’s amazing that we can buy that she’s being honest because of how talented Anne Baxter is, but that we can doubt her honesty because of how talented Eve Harrington is. Genius. 

Bette Davis is everything. She perfectly plays the kind of dramatic woman who can’t help but speak with her face even though she knows it betrays her insecurities. The way she snuffed every cigarette after smoking maaaaybe 7% of it rocked. Her single earring rocked. Her eyes and eyebrows rocked. I expect that it would be hard to command the screen in a role where you were insecure about losing your stardom and job to someone else, but Bette Davis threads that needle perfectly.

Celeste Holm, Ritter, and Marilyn Monroe (!) turnt it too. I’d you haven’t seen this movie, you really should fix that asap. I promise it isn’t old and inaccessible!!

When my mom got her first iPhone it had an unlimited cellular plan, which meant that she would let me watch 3 videos on a loop on the factory-installed YouTube app (remember when Apple did that?). I wore the proverbial tape out watching Madonna’s <i>Material Girl</i> music video. Something about that whole scene tickled my ten year old brain like no other. I eventually learned that it was an homage to a scene in some old movie with Marilyn Monroe in it, but for some reason it took me another ten years to fall in love with the rendition of “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend” in <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>. I am sorry to my inner child, but Madonna is cute and Marilyn is gorgeous, and, well, gorgeous, is… you know, gonna devour cute.

I really loved this movie in ways I didn’t expect! I went into it blind (save for Miss Square-Cut-or-Pear-Shaped) and was so surprised by how lovely the friendship was between Dorothy and Lorelei. I loved seeing an unconditional and wholly loving relationship between two women on screen. Both women were entirely self-assured and I felt little lightning bolts shooting out of my toes for the entire movie because of how excited I was to see that.

Watched in honor of Val Kilmer, who got on screen with two of the best actors of all time and absolutely nailed it. His ability to steal the scene no matter its other occupants should be studied. I saw clips of his big shootout all over Twitter when he died( and it works even better in the movie. Goddamn. And “the sun rises and falls with her, man” !!!

Ughhhh I don’t think I got this movie. I watched it with my dad which should have been the unlock code!! This is perfect dad cinema. Alas, he and I hooted and hollered at all the same things. He and my mom and I all agreed that the best scenes were the final bank heist because of the #vibes and that scene where Hanna and McCauley get coffee because it’s just two goats munchin away

Camerawork was usually great but occasionally perplexing, the styling was great for the time period but hard to look at because of how bad the nineties were, the score was fucking awesome, and I chewed off my fingernails and toenails the entire twenty minutes of the bank heist.

Cannot tell what I thought of the Lauren storyline. 

So much of the non-Pacino/de Niro/Kilmer acting was not to my taste. The lighting was sometimes heinous. The dialogue was atrocious coming out of anyone except the aforementioned trio.

There are two things that betray this movie and its lack of feminism beyond anything surface level:

(2) the outfits in the third level fantasy world.

I understand why the women would be scantily clad in Babydoll’s second reality, given that it was a brothel. What I don’t understand is the in-universe reason for why they would all have their boobs our to fight dragons and the robots from <i>Robots</i>. Had Snyder put these ladies in equally intricate but much more conservative outfits, I would have bought that the third level was the ultimate escape for Babydoll. Instead we’re supposed to think that Babydoll is (literally) fantasizing about being half naked and strong as an escape from her reality where she is half naked and being forced into sex work. I juuuuuuuuust think that if Snyder had actually given a hoot about making a bigger point about gendered violence he would have made different choices.

Nicole Kidman’s astounding performance anchors a plot so outlandish that the only way through it is to take it seriously, and boy oh boy are you rewarded if you do. <i>Birth</i> is a monument to grief and how encompassing it can be. Anna is so full of it that she can believe a 10 year old is her reincarnated husband! Kidman throws herself so bravely into the role that you’re right there with her. At one point I chastised myself for proffering solutions for each of Pseudo Sean’s factoids (“obituary” “educated guess” “attention to detail”), but then felt silly for missing that I was doing exactly what Anna et al. were doing internally too! They were all as smart as I am and they all had the same thoughts and grief meant that one of them disregarded all common sense to run away with a fourth grader. I knew this movie rocked beforehand, but that realization helped me figure out why this wasn’t schlocky. Under shakier hands, I expect <i>Birth</i> would have easily veered into laughable and creepy territory. Thank goodness for Nic and Jonathan Glazer.

Both Hepburn and Peck gave incredible, lived-in performances. Hepburn plays a princess so convincingly, and she and Peck are so sweet n tender. Hepburn is in awe of a world that has existed without her, and you feel a sadness from her in realizing how much she’s missed. Peck is in awe of Hepburn discovering that world, and the protectiveness he feels seems earned <i>and</i> ernest. Rom com really done right.

- One day I’ll watch a Sidney Lumet movie that isn’t about the justice system/cops, but today wasn’t that day
- Al Pacino is the greatest actor of all time
- The colors… the grain… the warmth… good god. Do NOT watch this movie on a hot day. The level of sweaty grunginess increased over the movie in a way that felt physically oppressive on a relatively chilly day. The actual heat increased alongside the proverbial heat, so by the end you were stuck under this giant raft of hot air and discomfort. Nice!
- The way Lumet plays with space is so so cool. <i>12 Angry Men</i> obv takes place in the jury deliberation room, but he can make it feel small or expansive depending on the moment. In this, the bank feels huge and full of possibilities and the street outside is what feels claustrophobic. The spectators, police, and buildings on either side of the street loom over you (and, more importantly, Sonny) in such a scary way. Lumet is so so good at moving around inside that dynamic
- What a tight script!!! Went in fully blind and knew that this movie was going to rock as soon as Mr. 5’6” was doing those hops to cover the cameras in the bank. The hostages—particularly Sylvia and Maria—were awesome analogues for the viewer. The Leon reveal actually had me pause and up out of my seat. Lumet and Pacino have you oscillating between desperation and hope so many times that you’d think the schtick would get exhausting, but no! Those final two minutes were perfection.

Could have been about the characters themselves given how fun n odd they were, but I love that it was about their relationships instead. Travis and Hunter walking along parallel sidewalks mirroring train tracks—but this time they unite instead of remaining feet apart forever—really got me.

I appreciate that this is a 5 star movie but I don’t connect w it in the way that I want so it’s stuck at 4.5 for me for a minute. Ugh!

I think that this is a movie ripe for analysis in a high school English class and I mean that as a compliment. Vito and Anthony’s scene in the tomato vines, for example: Vito struggling to pass control to the next generation, micromanaging how they do things even when it doesn’t matter much, the literal (water) gun, his go-to being his pretending to be a monster, the boundary between Vito as a character and Vito as a person blurring even for family, tending to a garden you won’t live to see fruit, Anthony not knowing what is pretend and what is real, and Vito laying there in the silence alone. Like, yeah! I got it and I think it was executed beautifully and I totally understand why people loooove this movie. I could have written a lot of 5 page papers about this in high school. But does that make a movie great? Are symbolism and a prolific use of motifs enough to elevate a movie to GOAT status? No! But don’t worry, Coppola doesn’t rely on those. They’re part of an incredibly rich tapestry backed up by phenomenal acting and cinematography. The characters and world feel so big that I didn’t want to call this a “slice of life” movie, because those often feel like they miniaturize whatever slice they’ve taken. <i>The Godfather</i> is hefty and chewable and requires you pay attention for 3 full hours (not a bad thing!! Good, in fact). I just didn’t emotionally connect w it. So 🤷‍♀️

A recent metric for movie judgement is “does this distract me from what’s on my mind for the duration of the movie?”/“how engaging is this?” Not all movies are meant to be engaging! But the Mission: Impossible franchise certainly is. It fails here. It lets your bad mood be in the background during the big ups, but most of the time you have enough faith in the IMF team that the stakes don’t grab you enough to reroute your mind to what’s happening right in front of you. And if a popcorn movie isn’t interesting enough to do that, what good is it really? Hoping that the rest of the series brings back my ability to doubt that the team will pull it off; if they’re invincible, I both cannot fear their failure and cannot appreciate their success.

You can really see why McQuarrie directed the rest of the series. He took everything that worked from the previous four and it was notably better:
- Opening with the plane stunt was genius. Starts momentum as opposed to the Burj Khalifa stunt which bisected <i>Ghost Protocol</i> in a weird way. And getting the stunt where he jumps up the pole only 16 mins into the movie… hell yeah.
- Rebecca Ferguson may have been initially brought in for the chemistry read just because she looks like Michelle Monaghan, but she stayed because she and Tom Cruise were fab together!
- Tom Cruise short joke
- Insane BMW product placement, motorcycles, and high-speed chases through cities in Muslim-majority countries.
- Shirtless scenes, ladies looking gorg in great dresses. Seems like we need at least one black tie/white tie scene in each movie.
- Benji! I don't love him as much as other reviewers seem to, but his comic relief is necessary and Simon Pegg thankfully mostly plays him as sincere

5. I also like the “we’ll figure it out” refrain. It feels like a way to acknowledge that these movies are not about planning the perfect mission.

I've had a weird and shitty month, so I decided that this fine Friday evening was the right time to take too many mushrooms and watch a movie. My rookie mistake was not narrowing down a list of movies from which to choose prior to the mushrooms hitting, so I frantically sped (ha) through my watchlist hoping to find something. Run Lola Run? No, couldn't deal with any real tension. Tron: Legacy? No, I needed something good. Speed Racer? That old movie my brother (Henry) and godbrother (Crash) would watch ad nauseam in the background while I hung out at my godmother's house? Sure. Fuck it. It's the Wachowski sisters and the internet says it's trippy. Here I sit 135 minutes later with tears streaming down my face. 

I sent Henry at least 75 texts while watching this, half of which simply said ""aura aura aura."" Speed Racer himself joins the ranks of the coolest protagonists of all time, and has inspired me to make a <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/katswnt/list/unspeakable-unbeatable-unsurpassable-aura/"" rel=""nofollow"">list with those characters</a>. ""Hey, I have a meeting with my accountant in a few. Yeah, I would recommend him, want his number? His name is Speed Racer"" like C'MON, what else was that kid gonna do? 

Its visuals were so dialed in that you could mistake them for Kid Pix excellence. They grew frenetic alongside the story and tightened back up without you even noticing at first. The different races had their own visual cues; I loved how fluid and loose the colors got during Casa Cristo, lines snaking all over the screen and dust flying like they were driving along the Fury Road. The Grand Prix itself had me up and off the couch. Speed flipping the cars as he passed the cameras made me gasp. I mean, what else are movies for?

But despite the visuals and despite the excitement of the finishes, all I could think of while watching this movie was Henry and Crash in my godmother's living room with their hot wheels. I am no race car driver, but I've been spending a lot of time recently reflecting on what it means to be an older sister. There's a moment when Spritle asks if he can come with Speed, and Speed finally understands something fundamental about both Rex and about being an adult. He turns to his younger brother and tells him “you’ll understand when it’s your turn.” That line forced me to pause the movie so I could get out a few wracking sobs without covering up the dialogue. I think every person has been told “you’ll understand when it’s your turn,” and that feels frustrating and devastating and isolating. And then one day you're the person saying it to someone else, and all of a sudden everything that came before makes a little more sense. Being an older sister is the hardest, most rewarding thing that's ever happened to me, and Speed made it feel a little easier. I didn’t go into this movie expecting it to make me sit with feelings of who I want to be as a person and as a sister (and even as a parent one day!!), but the Racers look a lot like my family and it felt really cathartic to see that on screen at the same time as Speed drives down and then right back up a cliff. There is a lot of confusion in this world, but your loved ones and super sick racing moves get you through it. I mean that so seriously, btw.

IDK. This review sucks. I'm still on mushrooms. Tears are running into my mouth while I type. I have no idea how to convey how much this movie means to me right now in this moment. All I know is that I wish I could travel back in time and squeeze little Henry and little Crash as tight as I possibly could. The Wachowski sisters are geniuses.

The Vesper plot line was so horrible.

2025-11-08,Frankenstein,2025,https://boxd.it/bDCqqT,3,,"<i>“Can you contain your fire, Prometheus? Or will you burn your hands before delivering it?”</i>

To preface this, <i>Frankenstein</i> is one of my favorite books ever. I just went and found my copy from 9th grade and every single page is annotated. I found so much inspiration in Mary Shelley (and her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft) and her deeply feminist novel. Reading <i>Frankenstein</i> was one of the first times that I felt a deep emotional proximity to a time that came so long before mine. I now spend much of my time chasing art that gives me that feeling. Shelley wrestled with topics around gender/sex that a naïve fifteen year old me thought women of yore must have only approached imprecisely and indelicately. I remember being so shocked by Shelley’s care and creativity when exploring ideas like the creation of life (and its sanctity), how we are reflected in the world by our creations, and how women operate in a world that so values them for their ability to create particular things (people, certainty not novels).

I’m embarrassed to say I haven’t read the book in ~5 years, so I will plow through the aforementioned copy and update my review if my opinions change.

I am not an adaptation purist, and am of two minds here. One is that it feels as though this adaptation is for those who love the book: Elizabeth serves to bring in more explicit ties between the Creature and parenthood, the Creature is very literally a construction of ideal masculinity, and Frankenstein’s ego is all the Prometheus-ity someone familiar with the book would need. If you’ve read the book, this is a beautiful visualization of a world with which you are familiar. Guillermo del Toro was made to make such a movie, and we had fun for two and a half hours! 

The other part of me, however, is left disappointed by the lack of adherence to the most interesting parts of Shelley’s novel. In this movie, Frankenstein and the Creature are not clearly two sides of the same coin. We get a clever nod to Frankenstein seeing himself as God during the confession scene, but his performance in the tribunal failed to convey his hubris in a meaningful way. The role of women and mothers seemed relegated to the dead wife montage in Frankenstein’s origin story. Finally, the notion of obligation for that which we create is almost mocked as Frankenstein repeatedly ridicules the Creature’s desire for a companion; we’re nearly browbeaten into agreeing that no other Creature should ever be created, which is an argument that could have been won with nuance and compassion. 

Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth were standouts. Oscar Isaac is normally a favorite, but I felt he didn’t do a particularly great job as Frankenstein himself. Practical sets get applause yet everything looked digital. Costumes were simply sumptuous 🤌. Excited to re-read and then re-watch.

It is not fan service but offers plenty to devotees of Frank Herbert’s novel; Denis Villeneuve manages to bring the original text to life such that you’re constantly thinking “that’s exactly how I pictured it!” On the flip side, I know you don’t need to have read the book first to fall in love with this movie because my first encounter w the Dune universe was through this film! Its confidence in its world building, characters, and story is such that you’re sucked in and have complete faith that you’ll know what you need to know when you need to know it.

Like, guys, I get it. I really do. I just found it so discordant in a way that did little to further its thesis that I cannot say I enjoyed it nor found it interesting. At one hour in I thought to myself “Jesus Christ we’re only one hour in?” At the hour forty five mark I thought to myself “holy shit only 45 more minutes have passed?” If you are not going to entertain me you must at least offer food for thought, but this gave little to gnaw on. I wish the scope had been less ambitious; there were a few interesting movies in here that would have all been worthy of pursuit.

I think the parts that worked best were the employee party, the sex scene between Christian and Anne, the moment Christian is revealed to be a father, and the gala dinner. These were the moments in which I felt the audience and the movie were on the same side of the conversation we were having with the subject matter. 
- Employee party was a nice way to explore that trope of self-serious people pretending to let go because it felt really fun to see how seriously everyone took the task of letting go. The dynamic of a work event is a nice lens for this!
- The sex scene was an interesting way to show performance and self-consciousness and fundamental disconnect put filters on how we interact with others at our theoretically most stripped down (literally). Everything is weird but we do what we think we’re supposed to do and what we think is normal and it just results in everyone having a weird and bad time. 
- Christian being a dad is such a duh because it so fits with how self centered he is. Of course we wouldn’t know about his kids, they have zero impact on his life if they’re not in front of him.
- Gala dinner was pretty heavy handed but I liked it anyway. I think women watching the movie would have the same instinct I did, which is that giving permission for a man to behave as a “wild animal” will inevitably lead to sexual assault. I also think women and men would have a very different assumption about how help would arrive; I can imagine male audience members feeling as though they’d intervene earlier, while female audience members would be unsurprised by the lack of help. Watching the artist and curator have no idea how to interact with the art was probably meant to be a larger part of that scene, but that was less interesting to me. 

But then we get scenes like the apology video. Ohhhhh my god I get it Christian is making it about him and about bullshit and missing 100% of the point. Oh my god I get it. Oh my god. Like, lots of ideas and very little execution!!

I didn’t like this movie and wrote this much because I feel like I need to justify that dislike.

One day Rian Johnson woke from a dream in a panic. “My god,” he said. “There is a young woman attending Wellesley College who has read every single story ever published by Agatha Christie, and she needs me right now.” Thus <i>Knives Out</i> was born. 

Nobody needed to tell me that the exterior of the Thrombley house was filmed at the Hunnewell estate. You can see Wellesley’s campus in the establishing shot there, and I can recognize those turrets drunk in the dark without my glasses (ask me how I know). I’ve walked past that house ~100 times. I’ve driven those streets more times than I can count. Benoit Blanc is in my neighborhood, and his version of Christie’s Belgian detective is hanging out outside of Moody’s and cruising down Washington St at 52 mph. 

While this doesn’t lift directly from a Christie story (I would know), Benoit Blanc is very clearly Hercule Poirot. Great choice to have him switch to being Southern; the accent is similarly disarming and similarly charming. Daniel Craig gives a career best performance as Blanc, and it’s so fun to watch him have fun. I liked the choice to not give him a Hastings; Marta functioned as the hapless-sidekick-to-whom-things-would-be-explained, but her having inside knowledge gave it a Roger Ackroyd twist that was super satisfying as a viewer.

Toni Collette was a casting masterstroke. She’s doing things here that no one else is doing. Ana de Armas crushes it. Chris Evans perfectly cast too. Lakeith Stanfield… you are a genius and also you should call me.

I’m trying to write a review for a movie I greatly enjoyed and I can’t! Had a bad day today, and Father Jud’s “daily bread” has really stuck in my noggin. As a nonreligious person, the places faith shows up in my life often surprise me, but recently I mostly notice it (or the lack thereof) as faith in myself. I’ve been spending a lot of time trying to find that “daily bread.” <i>Wake Up Dead Man</i> is not a particularly heavy meditation on what keeps the faith, but for some reason my takeaway from it was that most people have to wake up every day and work pretty fcking hard at keeping that torch lit. That felt good (“my experience is common, I’m not alone”) and bad (“great, so it’s gonna be like this forever”). Kinda weird that a murder mystery struck such a nerve, but life is kinda weird right now.

I can’t help but love this movie. Why do all movies filmed in the early 2000s look this perfect?

This movie is so core to my family that my dad and sister have matching tattoos of the wolf raising his fist. We all know every line. I’ve seen this movie at least a dozen times. It usually just brings comfort, but this time I thought about what it means to change and who will be there for you while you do. Mr. Fox needed to get his shit together in a very different way than I feel I need to get mine, but I saw a lot of myself in him this round. I love when you get to watch a movie and find a whole new emotional angle.

Today I had a weird, mostly beautiful day. Holidays carry a lot of feelings. What was I doing during Christmas last year? Does this Christmas look like how I thought it would? What will next year’s Christmas look like? Who will I be then? Will she be wiser, stronger, or smarter? Will she look back on me with kindness, pity, or understanding? Who will be by my side then?

While watching, my whole family kept interrupting to tell each other how happy we are to have each other and how different and weird we all are. I cried a few times thinking about how much we all change over time and yet, no matter what, always come back together to be ~different~. I don’t know who Kat will be next Christmas, but I know she’ll be different and be surrounded by people who love her. That’s what matters.

2025-12-27,Sentimental Value,2025,https://boxd.it/cfFEXv,5,,"<i>""It's hard to love someone who is full of anger.""</i>

Sometimes it’s painful for me to engage with art that shows me an unflattering version of myself. Nora is intentionally unreadable and wants nothing more than a home. She desperately wants those around her to see her, and yet nothing is scarier to her. She asks her father why he disappeared and how he could possibly think he knows her because the alternative—him knowing her and choosing to stay away—is much, much worse. She is only able to express herself through her art, because the moment someone indicates they want to try knowing her is the moment she withdraws. Nora and Rachel’s conversation about whether the character’s sadness is “such an overwhelming part of her” and is “just the cause of everything, or is… a symptom of something deeper” is the closest we see Nora allow someone to get to her, and that’s only because her defenses were down. I’m happy to say I (mostly) no longer feel like Nora; my desperation to be seen is turning into a love for those who see me, and I’m much better at letting more of myself be known now. 

When Gustav is asking Nora to be in his movie, he tells her that “it’s hard to love someone who is full of anger,” but that is exactly what this movie makes it so easy to do. In a story about how artists use their art to convey emotions they otherwise have no access to, we see Gustav literally try to script and direct a repair with his eldest daughter. She refuses to participate in the movie Gustav is asking her to star in, but is still dragged into the emotional turmoil brought by her father’s return. The movie is the vehicle for understanding whether she participates in it or not (sidebar: it's funny that I am pulling a Gustav here, and using a movie as a safer proxy to talk about my year and my feelings). Nora and Gustav are flawed and actively make it hard to care for them, but we see (far more than they do) how easy it is to love them. Agnes is the key here, and her ability to show her love for her family members gives both Gustav and Nora an example they tentatively hope they can follow.

Stalin has that quote about decades where nothing happens and weeks where decades happen; this year has felt like a series of weeks-where-decades-happen for me, and it felt like Sentimental Value portrayed the same thing. Sometimes we are pulled—ready or not—into growth and change and progress that feels stagnant while within it and profound once you’re out. This year it has felt like time keeps bunching up into these weird, shattering moments. Many of these moments were about being a sister and what it means to care for others, so I'd like to thank Trier for reaching into my brain while writing this movie.

When Nora said she didn’t need therapy because she knew too much about herself already, I was reminded of times when I’ve felt like Nora and knew, subconsciously, that cracking the door would lead to more change than I felt ready for. Nora’s attempt to keep the door held was visibly exhausting and clearly tormented her, and yet it was clear that Nora was trying to take care of herself in the only way she knew how. Instead of an overwrought self-pity party, Renate Reinsve’s astounding performance makes us sympathize with Nora without feeling frustrated at her emotional constipation. 

That final scene of the Borgs actually filming the movie made me cry for many reasons, one of which was that it was an example of how things that previously felt impossible become real once you’re able to untangle your own emotional knot a little bit. I certainly imposed this feeling on Nora a bit here, but this year I’ve continuously found myself in situations I thought myself unequipped to handle, only to surprise myself by how well I navigate them. Much like Nora’s stage fright in the first scene, sometimes it doesn’t matter if you’re ready to go out on stage because you just have to <i>go</i>.","2020s, love sucks movie fest 2025, w/ dad, w/ mom, neon, !american, !in english, hey that's the name of the movie, movie about making movies, good cinematography, beautiful, good acting, good styling, incredible performance, feeling seen, i love my dad, long review, criterion collection, profile",2025-12-26

I think Hou's decision to set this as Vicky-in-10-years telling us about the present day was genius; I felt Vicky was a reliable narrator, and think it's so cool that she was able to show such a realistic and unflattering portrait of her time ten years ago. It's hard to do that without over explaining yourself or trying to desperately demonstrate how you've grown from such an experience, so I think the way Hou went about demonstrating her interiority was super interesting!!!

How are we meant to keep living with this trail of selves and relationships stretching so far behind us? What happens when we're the person who set those things down, and we don't know if we were right to do so? I think a shallower reading of the movie is ""some things end, life moves on,"" but has anything <i>really</i> ended for Julie? Did she ever move forward, or just on to new versions of the same?

I just watched <a href=""https://boxd.it/chQchh"" title=""Millennium Mambo""><i>Millennium Mambo</i></a><i></i>, and found it connected to this movie well. Both are an unflattering self-portrait that isn’t begging for absolution, just trying to see clearly. They’re about looking back at a younger self without fully disowning her or excusing her, just letting her stand there in all her avoidance, as a work in progress. 

I didn't see as much of myself in Julie as others seem to, and I'm worried that's not because we're different but is because I, like her, have an ability to self-reflect that ends when we get to the juicy bits. The movie is full of those moments where you can feel Julie hovering at the edge of a hard truth and then choosing motion instead of depth: a new job, a new relationship, a new story about who she is. 

The ""messy young woman"" thing sometimes feels overwrought, but watching these movies back to back has really helped me feel less alone in the whole ""I'm in my mid/late twenties and don't know what the hell I'm doing"" thing I have going on rn. I feel silly typing that, because who <i>doesn't</i> think that when they're my age, but I think that's the point of art like this: taking the most common experiences in the world and showing how we all manage to feel like we're the only person going through it.

This movie is (almost) bookended by Hubert telling Vinz the above quote. This movie is one continuous chant: “so far, so good.” We move through locations and schemes and time stamps and remind ourselves “so far, so good.” The quote’s second moment, near the end, signals that the ground is closer than it appears and that we are about to find out how Hubert, Saïd, and Vincent are going to land. We are allowed to trick ourselves into thinking someone might slide a mattress beneath them at the last moment. We hope that the landing isn’t going to be what we think it is. “So far, so good.” Then we hit the ground.

Henry walked in when Bond was sneaking around and said “bro is conspicuousmaxxing” and I think that sums up the movie. Bro drives his AM DB5 to the secret location but just parks it uncovered outside. But ya know what? It’s literally fine. Bond being sexy is a huge part of why he’s interesting.","2010s, love sucks movie fest 2025, hey that's the name of the movie, spy movie, james bond, w/ henry, good score, best sound winner",2026-01-13

CAN LOVE EVEN EXIST WITHOUT CLARITY? IS THAT TYPE OF LOVE INHERENTLY SELF DESTRUCTIVE?

Astoundingly awesome cinematography and editing. All the eyeball povs?? Come on. Also, is anyone doing a better job at integrating screens/devices than Park Chan-wook (see <i>No Other Choice</i>)???

Love the symbolism. The eye drops that let him see clearly. Seo-rae’s wrist bruise reveal at the fish market, a wet n sloppy place where physical mutilation happens constantly and without emotion. The fog of Ipo and most people leaving because of the fog, but Seo-rae choosing to move into it. Altitude and gravity. Gloves/barriers between touch. Translation and mistranslation. Ooh!! Kicking my wee feeties and wishing I was in my high school English class again

I knoooooow the first and second acts were supposed to be distinct but I felt like they didn’t come together in the way I’d have liked. When Park nails that move he <i>nails it </i>(<i>The Handmaiden</i>), when he doesn’t it leaves me feeling a little bummed out (<i>Lady Vengeance, Decision to Leave</i>).","2020s, love sucks movie fest 2025, good cinematography, good acting, hey that's the name of the movie, !american, female writer, incredible performance, good score, !in english, good editing, cops, symbolism central",2026-01-17
2026-01-19,Who Killed Captain Alex?,2010,https://boxd.it/cIiAbd,5,,"I normally do a single quote at the top of my reviews, but this movie was so good I'm narrowing it down to my top dozen (or so) favorite quotes:
<i>- “I’m making German food.” “German food?” “Yeah, I found some German tourists and I’m cooking them.”
- “They walk slow because they think slow”
- “Now… Captain Alex: The Musical”
- “Everybody in Uganda knows kung fu!”
- “And know this, you diarrhea squirt: I want my brother back!”
- “Welcome to Dangerous Zone”
- “Ugandan Bruce Lee… we call him Bruce U”
- “He fights drugs… and uses drugs.”
- “We need to attack very early because I’m on vacation and want to go dancing later. And maybe go to the beach.”
- “Get ready. Tighten your seatbelts.”
- “Ugandan Ghetto Air Force”</i>

In the age of generative AI, I've turned to art more and more to try and feel that connection to the greater human experience. Sometimes I'm crying in museums in front of paintings, sometimes I'm listening to <i>drivers license</i> while wondering how heartbreak feels the same for everybody but so so different each time, and sometimes I'm watching movies that convey a passion and joy for the art form so clearly that my toes curl and my hair stands straight up. 

<i>Who Killed Captain Alex?</i> is absolutely not ""so bad it's good,"" it's just straight up good. There is so much love for cinema oozing out of every single aspect of it that you can't help but love it. It is an ode to action and to kung fu and to mafia movies and revenge plots. It takes seriously that which other movies had already discarded to the ""for satire only pile"" (my dad asked if this was released before or after <i>Tropic Thunder</i>).

One of the smartest, funniest choices is VJ Emmie. He drags you into the movie with him. He cheers, rewinds, threatens, and lets you know when he thinks something is just really fcking awesome (and he’s always right). It turns the act of watching into a communal event; instead of distancing you from the film's limitations, it collapses the gap entirely. You are not watching <i>at</i> the movie, but watching <i>with</i> it.

The commitment from the actors is unreal. Nobody is winking, nobody is embarrassed. The stakes are enormous because the actors believe in them. The kung fu is scrappy and inventive and cool, and the actors clearly trained for this because they wanted to, not because a franchise demanded it. Every fight feels like a love letter to action cinema instead of a Netflix-style ""oh shit we have to bring attention back to the screen between TikTok scrolls.""

Thank god for sincerity. <i>Who Killed Captain Alex?</i> feels like people declaring ""we are going to make this no matter what."" In a moment where so much art feels optimized for viewership, I am so so so grateful to get to see art with joy and nerve. You really just have to make things. Get a camera, get a microphone, get some friends, tighten your seatbelts, and have some fun.","2010s, love sucks movie fest 2025, w/ dad, i love my dad, smoke a j first, !american, !in english, bass pro shop, notable fourth wall break, revenge, long review",2026-01-18
